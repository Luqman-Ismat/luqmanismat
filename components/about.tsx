              With years of experience in{" "}
              <span className="text-foreground font-medium">EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction)</span>, I
              have worked on projects as a{" "}

                Process Engineer, Piping Systems Engineer, and a Process Safety Lead
              </span>
              . My focus has been on designing and optimizing engineering workflows to improve efficiency and execution.
              As technology continues to evolve, I see a massive opportunity to{" "}
              <span className="text-foreground font-medium">integrate AI and automation into engineering</span> to

              I am working on developing <span className="text-foreground font-medium">AI-driven tools</span> that will
